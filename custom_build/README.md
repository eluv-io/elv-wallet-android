# Custom Wallet Build (Android)
## Getting Started
1. [Import the project](docs/Importing.md)
2. [Configure your build](docs/Configuration.md)
3. Decide how to build:
    * [GitHub Actions](docs/GithubActions.md) - This option requires the least amount of setup. 
    * [Android Studio](docs/AndroidStudio.md) - Build locally with minimal command line usage.
    * Command line - Requires setting up Java and Android SDK manually (not covered in this guide).
